            <br>
            Just remember, if you want the nuts and bolts to building your new underground home, you need the DVD set

              Great How-To Book</strong><br>
            This book illustrates and explains how to create an affordable underground house with far more advantages
            than an above ground house. Explains step by step planning, materials, construction, features, and some
            sample layouts to get you started. Along with much more.<br>

              Excellent for what it is</strong><br>
            This book is quite interesting and is, as far as I can tell, intended as a primer to the concept rather than
            a complete recipe. Once you read this book you understand the major concepts at play, can visualize the
            options available, and understand why some ideas work and others don't. It thoroughly covers major pitfalls,
            practical lessons from the over 30 years these houses have been actually built (well, centuries if you want
            to count older methods for building them) and has a good update from the author in the back. I found it VERY
            useful as I am interested in this method of construction and this book has confirmed my interest while
            pointing me in very useful directions to get further information.<br>
            <br>
            If you are at all interested in building your own home, take a look at this construction method and
            understand why there are such huge advantages over standard "clapboard" styles of construction - a high
            quality earth-structured home will trump a high quality freestanding home in almost every single regard
            every time.

            way. Get them both. The only other natural material, owner-builder books of this profundity are: Ken Kern's
            "The owner built home" and the gorgeous treatise on building with cob, "The hand-sculpted house." Most

            A Expensive log homes for the really rich<br>

            C This book, for those who truly want to integrate innovation and low cost with deep Earth comfort and
            resilience and all the good stuff that goes with it.<br>
            <br>
            This book, in short, is in a class of its own. Most will notice that it was first offered in 1978. As the
            USA goes through a major financial crisis that proves nothing has changed--Wall Street and the two "parties"
            it has bought down to their lost souls are still here, still looting the commonwealth--this book proves that
            it is timeless.<br>
            <br>
            There is indeed a great deal of land across this great country where one can still afford to "dig in," and
            this could not be a better time to be thinking about renting what you have now in the close in fragile
            areas, and setting up alternative housing with adjacent land for a basic Life Garden.<br>
            <br>
            As I went through each chapter I found the list of materials, the prices, the diagrams, and the text all
            coherent, concise, and totally "on target." Black and white photographs throughout, and a handful of color
            photographs in the middle, round the book out.<br>
            <br>
            The book ends by discreetly recommending a tape series on design as the key element for success, and one
            that professional architects generally overlook (as we are all learning, the "experts" in finance and other
            areas are really "credentialed" but NOT experts).<br>
            <br>
            I LIKE THIS BOOK. As an afterthought, it is recommended by just about every major alternative living, green
            energy, and sanity outpost (Vermont, Oregon, Washington State) reviewer. This book is a "good deal" and
            inspiring to boot.<br>

              book!</strong><br>
            This is the best book I have read on alternative buildings. The author is very sensible about the whole
            project without being to much of a hippie. If my wife hadn't threatened divorce I would be building one of
            these houses right now. I HIGHLY recommend it!<br></p>

            I enjoyed this book very much and used it as a basis for designing an underground building for my plantation
            resort in India. Mike goes into good detail concerning how to build an inexpensive home using his techniques
            and there are plenty of pictures to help you understand the procedures. I haven't seen anything else out
            there as good as this for underground building...if you do please let me know.<br>

              book!</strong><br>
            I was amazed by this book. Not only does it provide plenty of details, but it is easy for anyone to
            understand.<br>
            <br>
            Some other reviews comment on some of Mike's opinions. You have to remember, the world of the 70's was a lot
            different from today. No Political Correct bull! It was common for national magazines to get off on the
            ranting of the turbulent times. This doesn't distract from the book though, and I personally think it adds a
            bit of character to the book.<br>
            <br>
            If you have ever thought of building an underground house, or getting away from the commercialism in modern
            society, this is the book for you. This is a must for the homesteader's library.<br>
            <br>
            If I could ask for other things in this book, it would be a bigger description of the newer building methods
            in the update section. Also, some more three dement ional drawings of the inside of the houses. You can
            figure out what's going on but sometimes you have to study the perspective drawings and pictures a bit. I
            agree with another reviewer, a biography would be nice.<br>
            <br>
            Great book, you will not be disappointed!<br>

            I first purchased this book about twenty years ago, then lent out my copy and have been without it for five
            years or more. Having recently bought a new copy, I have just finished re-reading it once again. I find the
            author's ideas to be intelligent, logical, and revolutionary. His personality comes through strongly as he
            is a man who is not afraid to state his opinions. I find this book to be an interesting read for this reason
            alone, but strongly recommend it on the basis of the building system he outlines. He explains to the reader,
            in simple, easily comprehensible language, just how to go about building a warm in winter, cool in summer,
            low cost home, that is easy on both the eye and the environment.A huge advantage is that a person living in
            such a home doesn't have to look at neighbor's homes, and, for their own part, is residing in a home that
            blends in with the surrounding countryside. If, by good fortune or good planning, one lives on enough
            acreage that viewing a neighbor's house is not an issue, there is still the benefit of having the home
            tucked away out of sight, part of the earth around it.Having never been the type to build a "impressive"
            home, I am more intersted in staying out of sight and being left alone. I enjoy the woods and wildlife. Mike
            Oehler shows us how to build a home that lets me do just that. <br></p>

              Book</strong><br>
            This book is excellent. I've wanted a copy for years, but now-a-days, it's very hard to find. I recommend it
            to everyone, provided you keep in mind the circumstances of rural Idaho. One person noted with horror the
            keeping of loaded guns (can be seen in the background of one of the photos). Don't forget Idaho<br>
            is bear country. And there is a bit of editorializing, but rural folk do that; you get used to it.<br>
            <br>
            I don't fully agree with the earth flooring, unless you were really trying to economize. Rather, I like the
            idea of laying down plywood under the carpeting, but not nailing it down - it's still moveable if you need
            to reach your piping, and it can move with the house if it shifts, but there's less settling than
            carpet/earth. I can't believe carpet/earth doesn't become lumpy eventually.The one thing missing (maybe it'd
            be better in another book), is a biography of Mike. How did he come by his acreage in Idaho. Did he spend
            all his money on land and have none for a house? How did he survive all these years, farming/hunting? A
            person still need cash for taxes and such. His books and his lecturing brings in a little money; does he do
            anything else? I'd be interested in knowing how to start a lecture circuit, or self publish a book. I think
            there's an audience for this kind of practical information.
