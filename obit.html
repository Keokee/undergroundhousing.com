                    <p>Mole Publishing founder and writer Mike Oehler, a proud back-to-the-land hippy and pioneer of underground housing and earth-sheltered greenhouses, passed away Feb. 2, 2016, at age 78, of natural causes at his home in northern Idaho. </p>
                    <p>Mike was born in Chicago and grew up nearby. After graduating from high school, he dropped out of college to pursue his writing career. He served in the U.S. Army before making his way to the West Coast where he worked as a crew member on fishing boats, worked in the Alaska goldmines, hired on with the U.S. Forest Service, cruised Mexico, and finally ended up in San Francisco where he embraced the hippy movement and lifestyle. </p>
                    <p>From there, he bought 46 acres in northern Idaho, around 1970, where he started experimenting with underground and earth-sheltered housing plus learned organic gardening, permaculture and off-the-grid living.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, he continued with his writings, earning international attention with his books, &ldquo;The $50 &amp; Up Underground House Book&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Earth-Sheltered Solar Greenhouse Book.&rdquo; He lectured or conducted workshops in Canada, England, Scotland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and 26 American states, frequently under the sponsorship of university architecture departments. He was the veteran of more than 100 radio and television interviews, including HGTV and the BBC.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>Mike had just finished his latest book &ldquo;How to Make a Hippy,&rdquo; due for release later this year. He was also the author of &ldquo;The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K&rdquo; and &ldquo;One Mexican&nbsp;<span data-term="goog_1265096586" tabindex="0">Sunday</span>&rdquo; and creator of the videos &ldquo;The Low-Cost Underground House Workshop and Survival Shelter Seminar Video Set&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Battle of Seattle.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>His family continues to operate Mole Publishing to make Mike's knowledge, writings and videos available to his many followers and fans.</p>
                    <p>The Pioneer of  Underground housing</em> and <strong>&ldquo;Tiny  Underground Homes&rdquo;</strong>, Mike self -published <em>The &nbsp;&nbsp;$50 </em>&amp; <em>Up Underground House Book &nbsp;</em>in  1978 (Mole Publishing Co), and had tripled  the size of his home/ underground office complex from 120 square feet to a  palatial 370 sq. ft., including built-in root cellar and wall-to-wall carpeting. Though totally underground the home/office  has 25 windows, sunlight and  good views. The original house went from a cost of $50 to $500 and then to  $2,000 a few years later with the addition of a really good $500 wood stove and  a modest $1,000 solar electric system. Here&rsquo;s the rest of Mike&rsquo;s story:</p>
                    <p>In the winters  of '72-'74, he hitchhiked around  the States with  his dog Bummer  doing free-lance lectures at colleges and high schools on both underground housing,  sponsored by architecture departments, and the back-to-the-land movement, sponsored by student environmental groups. </p>
                    <p>The AP did an article  which ran nationwide in 1977, and  in succeeding years  HGTV came to shoot a segment on his houses  as have TV crews from  the Netherlands, Greece  and the BBC (twice). In 1983 a Dutch alternative magazine sponsored a  lecture/workshop tour of Holland, Belgium, Germany,  England and Scotland. </p>
                    <p>Later in the '80s,  Mike spent  a couple of winters touring the U.S. by car  conducting workshops on the design and construction of underground houses,  shelters and greenhouses. But those were the Reagan years and all alternative lifestyles  were falling out of favor. Even  so, he did numerous TV and radio interviews along the way. In '92, Mike hired a  videographer to shoot both his completed structures and of Mike giving a workshop  with scale models of the &quot;Thirteen Approved Methods of Design&quot; for getting  light air and views - windows -- into houses, which are totally underground. He'd make the  attendees, or viewers, design five U houses of two to five rooms each on north,  south, east and west slopes, and one on flatland; and make them  design so &nbsp;that <em>each and every room in those  houses had windows  from all four sides, </em>with the idea that when  they designed their own houses later, they had the tools get windows in from at  least two sides in every room that matters. Each room would thereby have the  highly sought after &quot;corner office&quot;  effect. This is part of his <strong><em>3-DVD  set</em></strong> available for sale. </p>
                    <p>During his 47 years on his Idaho homestead, Mike  also <em>pioneered a radically new</em> <em>greenhouse  design</em>. It takes  tomatoes into the second week in December  year after year, and hardies like kale and cabbage  clear through the winter. True,  they're not still growing  in January, but they're still alive and edible and this is achieved without any  other heat source than sun and that stored in the earth. It is also achieved in  an area in which there is little winter sun and which is at 2,000-foot  elevation on the Canadian border. Thus he wrote about this in <strong><em>The  Earth-Sheltered Solar Greenhouse Book</em></strong><em>, </em>which that titanic publishing empire, Mole Publishing Company,  brought out in 2007. This book is a Nautilus Book Award Winner and well worth  reading. </p>
                    <strong>Many radical ideas  are met with resistance at first, often not gaining acceptance until after the  death of the innovator, but the world and its inhabitants are in such a mess  now, we believe underground&nbsp; housing,  with the&nbsp; 23 advantages it has over  conventional structures will be the housing of the&nbsp; future---if not before the earth cleansing  cataclysms, then certainly after</strong>.
