            underground with Mike Oehler’s PSP system<br></span><br>
          By J.D. Belanger, Countryside founder and editor<br>
          <p>The biggest investment most people have is their home. A mortgage, or rent, is a major item in most
            budgets. Many Americans who can’t scrape together a down payment on real estate, or get a mortgage loan,
            feel locked out of The Good Life, and the American Dream. And according to some sources, thousands of
            people, even in America, have no homes at all.<br></p>
          <p>Most people regard these as inevitable facts of life. Since there’s little they can do about them, they
            might as well ignore them.<br></p>
          <p>A few, however, are proactive. They think outside the box, and they have a fighting attitude. They consider
            huge, luxurious and expensive homes to be irrelevant to human needs, and wasteful of space, materials, and
            money. The cost of interest on a 20- or 30-year mortgage is especially galling to them.<br></p>
          <p>These housing pioneers have included Ken Kern, whose "Owner-Built Home" started many people on the road to
            mortgage-free housing in the 1970s. Rob Roy’s "Mortgage Free," as well as his books, videos and workshops on
            low-cost cordwood construction, have led the way out of the morass of overbuild, overpriced and consequently
            overfinanced housing.<br></p>
          <p>Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic dome enjoyed great popularity among owner-builders in the 1970s, and log
            construction has become so common most log homes are now built by commercial enterprises, not
            do-it-yourselfers. Other individuals and groups have been promoting building with straw bales, cob (a
            mixture of clay and straw), adobe, and houses that range, literally, from under the ground to the
            treetops.<br></p>
          <p>One of the people who has broken new ground (literally and figuratively) is Mike Oehler, author of "The $50
            & Up Underground House Book." His innovative and ingenious construction methods and design techniques have
            been in use for more than 20 years, but few people today are even aware of them.<br></p>
          <p>One reason might be because his methods are too easy, too "primitive," and maybe too inexpensive for most
            modern tastes.<br></p>
          <p>On the other hand, these qualities are exactly what some people are looking for… and what could become
            extremely valuable in certain situations.<br>
            <br>
            When planning this special feature on "Wilderness Survival," "Countryside" considered using the old "Boy
            Scout" and "Air Force Survival Manual" advice on emergency shelter. Frankly, we couldn’t envision readers of
            this magazine <i>needing</i> emergency shelter of any kind unless they became lost in the wilderness.
            Temporary and emergency shelters used after hurricanes and earthquakes are more likely to be Red Cross tents
            rather than something made from branches, or even tarps.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Mike Oehler has a different view. He thinks people will leave the cities in droves after a catastrophe,
            when population centers no longer function and are uninhabitable. They would seek food and shelter in the
            countryside.<br></p>
          <p>If they encounter Mike Oehler or anyone like him, they’ll be handed an ax, a shovel, a roll of
            polyethylene, and directions for building an underground shelter with the PSP system.<br>
            This building method is almost as fast, almost as easy, and almost as inexpensive as a Boy Scout hut with
            the same area. But with a little more work, time and money, you can build an actual home with the same
            method. Mike Oehler has lived in one himself for more than 20 years.<br></p>
          <p>Oh, by the way – this system can also be used to build root cellars and bomb and tornado shelters.<br></p>
          <div align="left">
            <p><b>This is something worth knowing about.<br></b><br>
              It’s safe to assume that most people have never considered living underground. Therefore they have never
              looked into the possibilities and know nothing about the concept.<br>
              However, it’s equally safe to assume that of those radical enough to not fit into that majority, most have
              heard only about concrete constructions that are relatively complex, expensive, and… well,
              basement-like.<br>
              <br>
              Mike Oehler’s PSP system, incorporating his unique design innovations, is a totally different concept. In
              its way it is both as simple and as amazingly ingenious as a paper clip.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Living underground<br></b> Underground homes, according to Mike, are not dark, dank, airless spaces,
              with artificial lighting… or even skylights. On the contrary, the properly designed and constructed U
              house provides pleasant surroundings, a better view (more on that later), and is most aesthetically
              pleasing, inside and out. It is weatherproof, soundproof, relatively fireproof, and requires less
              maintenance. It is warm in winter, cool in summer, has superior flooring, and the pipes never freeze. It
              has no foundation, uses less building material, requires less labor, and is ecologically sound. It can be
              concealed if you choose, defended if need be, and you pay less tax on it. It can be built by anyone, in a
              very short time, for hundreds, not tens of thousands of dollars.<br>
              Now are you interested in living underground?<br>
              <br>
              If we have your attention, <i>now</i> we can tell you that the key component of the Oehler PSP system is
              polyethylene sheeting.<br>
              <br>
              That, along with the "$50 & Up" price tag, is probably a psychological turn-off for those accustomed to
              thinking of even manufactured housing costing many thousands of dollars. Who would want to live in a $50
              <i>plastic</i> house! Let’s set that objection to rest first, by taking a quick look at the construction
              method, and why it makes so much sense.<br>
              <br>
              PSP stands for post/shoring/Polyethylene. These structures are, basically, pole building, built
              underground. The low cost projections assume the posts and shoring will come from the building site, or
              nearby.<br>
              <br>
              The space is excavated, posts are sunk, boards (shoring) placed against the posts between the posts and
              the earthen wall, polyethylene behind that, and the space is backfilled.<br>
              <br>
              The same basic method is used for the roof. Girders are placed on the posts and secured, beams are placed
              over the girders, boards go over the beams, followed by roofing felt or tar paper, poly, and earth.
              Insulation can be added to the roof to provide the same R-value with less soil (and weight).<br>
              <br>
              Many other details are added to this basic description in "The $50 & Up Underground House Book." The basic
              method, however, is all you would need to construct a secure emergency shelter, quickly and cheaply. It
              will be far more comfortable than the sod houses or rough log cabins of the pioneers, and its durability
              can’t begin to compare with that of a tent or similar shelter.<br>
              <br>
              If the poly still bothers you, consider these facts:<br>
              The very word plastic has a negative connotation for most homesteaders and environmentalists. We can use
              plastic sheeting for cheap greenhouses, but we know it won’t last more than a couple of months: definitely
              not what we would choose for building a home, however temporary.<br>
              <br>
              At the same time, poly is looked down upon because we’re told that in landfills, it will persist for
              perhaps a hundred years! It won’t degrade: it will just sit there.<br>
              Turn that negative into a positive. If polyethylene, protected from sunlight, will last a hundred years
              underground in a landfill, why wouldn’t it last that long when sandwiched between boards and earth in an
              underground house?<br>
              <br>
              This kind of brilliant breakthrough thinking is demonstrated in many ways in "The $50 & Up Underground
              House Book." Another example is how the use of treated wood for posts is eliminated.<br>
              <br>
              Fence posts and barn poles, sunk into the soil, get wet. Normally, wet wood rots. The industrial complex
              answer to this is to treat such wood with chemical preservatives (including, in the past, some that are
              now banned for being carcinogenic. But even those still in use are questionable.)<br>
              Anyone who has removed rotting fence posts has probably noticed that, in most soils, the area of decay is
              just below ground level, where soil microbiological activity is greatest. Often a post can be almost
              completely rotted out at this level, while the wood several feet deeper in the ground is still solid. So
              it’s possible that a post, buried two feet or more into the ground, in an excavation already as much as
              six feet or more in the ground, will last a very long time.<br>
              <br>
              But Oehler doesn’t take any chances, with either rot, or chemical preservatives.<br>
              He makes use of the old-time observation that charred wood doesn’t rot. He chars the bottom two feet or
              so, of the posts simply by roasting them over a campfire. If any finishing touches are necessary, he uses
              a propane torch.<br>
              <br>
              Then for additional insurance, he wraps the post bottom in several plastic garbage bags secured with duct
              tape.<br>
              <br>
              There is, obviously, much more to say about PSP construction methods, but that’s putting the cart before
              the house, especially if you aren’t convinced that subterranean housing is a reasonable alternative. What
              will convince you are the design possibilities. What’s more, before you start to build, you need a
              plan.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Design<br></b> The PSP construction process is simple and easily understood. But the concept of living
              under the ground is extremely alien to most people who haven’t been exposed to Mike Oehler’s design
              concepts. In addition, proper design is the single most important key to the success of an underground
              dwelling, in terms of light, ventilation, and most importantly, drainage.<br>
              <br>
              So it’s not surprising that Mike spends most of his time and effort, in his book as well as videos, on
              design.<br>
              <br>
              Conventional thinking (if that can be applied to something as radical as U housing) most often involves
              digging a hole into a hillside and plopping a structure there. A bank of windows faces downhill, while the
              uphill side is a solid blank wall. More often than not, if the house is on a south slope, the roof is
              pitched back into the hill, so drainage from the roof runs into drainage from the hillside. Leaks are
              almost inevitable. There is little or no air flow, the back of the house is dark and damp, and the view is
              limited.<br>
              <br>
              Mike calls this the first-thought design. His thinking has taken him far beyond that.<br>
              <img src="/images/firsthouse.jpg" width="216" height="138" border="0" align="right"><br>
              <b>The five approved methods of design<br></b> In his videos he stresses designs with views – and light
              and ventilation – in all four directions, and he urges viewers to try it themselves (with accompanying
              worksheets). Although some of the ideas are revolutionary, he simply calls them the Five Approved Methods
              of Design.<br>
              They are: the uphill patio; the off-set room; clerestories; the Royer foyer; and gables.<br>
              <br>
              <b>The uphill patio<br></b> The uphill patio is as useful as it is clever. It is basically a terraced
              garden area, with its bottom at any desired height from the floor of the house, and its top blending into
              the adjacent ground level. It not only solves problems of drainage and lateral thrust (the pressure of the
              earth on buried walls), but it can function as an emergency exit or a second entrance. It can also serve
              as a built-in greenhouse.<br>
              <br>
              Naturally, it admits light and air, even from the uphill side of the house which would otherwise be a dark
              blank wall. This not only reduces kerosene or electric bills but results in more balanced lighting.<br>
              <br>
              The view is up to the garden design interests and abilities of the owner, of course. Japanese courtyard
              gardens, which are world-renowned works of art, are offered as an example of the possibilities.<br>
              <br>
              And finally, the uphill patio offers a controlled view. It’s determined by the depth of the patio and the
              resultant trajectory of sight. No matter what anyone builds nearby, you won’t have to look at it if you
              don’t want to. (If the neighbor builds a 20-story high-rise one foot from your property line, put a
              greenhouse covering on the patio.) And no one can see into it (or your home) unless they’re standing right
              on top of it.<br>
              <b><br>
                The offset room<br></b> The basic U house design is a square or rectangular room. The simple expedient
              of adding a second room, and offsetting it to protrude into the uphill patio, provides the opportunity to
              install a section of windows which face an entirely different direction. This offers even more advantages
              of views, light, and ventilation. Elevating the offset room results in even more design possibilities.<br>
              <b><br>
                The Royer foyer<br></b> The Royer foyer is a design invention which allows us to have a good view down a
              hill without rechanneling the flow of drainage or interrupting the purity of design of a shed roof. The
              Royer foyer sneaks into the hillside rather than protruding from it. It makes possible a downhill view
              from windows that are all but concealed from neighbors.
            </p>
            <p>The foyer (named after the helper friend who came up with the idea) is a pie-shaped excavation away from
              the house on the side wall (not the downhill wall) of a downhill corner. It has many advantages and
              attributes, all discussed and illustrated in the book.<br>
              <b><br>
                Clerestories and gables<br></b> Clerestories and gables are nothing new, but they can be valuable
              contributions to underground housing. As might be expected, however, there are details to consider when
              incorporating them into an underground PSP house… where the three primary demands are drainage, drainage,
              and drainage. Details are provided in the book.
            </p>
            <p>Also included are discussions of earthen floors, built-in root cellars, earth coolers, a barbecue window
              and bachelor bar, plumbing and wiring considerations, engineering rules of thumb, scrounging materials…
              and everything else you’ll need to know to build your own pleasant, comfortable and affordable underground
              home.<br>
              <b><br>
                Construction of an emergency shelter<br></b> You really need the book, and perhaps the videos, to get a
              good grasp of the construction method and, more importantly, design considerations. But many readers who
              don’t consider themselves candidates for building an underground house – or even a root cellar or tornado
              shelter – might appreciate knowing how it’s done, just in case. Mike Oehler covers this aspect in his
              latest book, "The Hippie’s Guide to Y2K" (see review in 83/3:110). He calls it the Pit House. It’s as
              simple as this:<br>
              <br>
              Dig a hole. Cover it with logs. Cover the logs and exposed sides with polyethylene. Put four to six inches
              of earth on the poly.
            </p>
            <p>He does suggest a few tricks to make the job easier and the shelter better. For example, use the earth
              thrown out of the hole as part of the structure, so you don’t have to dig as deep. You want the roof
              sloping, not flat. On a slope, put most of the soil on the uphill side, forming a V with the pointed side
              uphill. This will divert surface water around the shelter, keeping it drier. Reading both books will give
              you many other ideas.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Conclusion<br></b> The PSP method of underground construction – and Mike Oehler – provide a wonderful
              opportunity for Countryside to transition into the new millennium. Here’s why:<br>
              Mike Oehler became involved with underground housing in the hippie heydays of the 1970s. In that regard,
              some people will consider it history, as passé as geodesic domes made from junked auto hoods.<br>
              <br>
              But, as we hope the accompanying article makes clear, the advantages of U housing are both numerous and
              impressive. There is no reason why the thousands of Countrysiders who say they can’t afford conventional
              housing, even mobile homes, can’t build their own underground PSP homes. What’s more, the many thousands
              of others who are paying interest on mortgages that double (and more) the cost of their already overpriced
              conventional housing could reduce their housing investment and eliminate the interest cost entirely. In
              many cases this would also eliminate the need for an outside job, allowing more people to become full-time
              homesteaders.<br>
              And it goes much further. It extends into the future.<br>
              <b><br>
                A glimpse of the future?<br></b> Some readers will recall that in several articles on our vision of the
              21st century, when the general populace will live lives that very closely resemble what we now call
              homesteading, the houses were underground, in park-like settings.<br>
              <br>
              Mike Oehler anticipated this more than 20 years ago by including the drawing on the previous page in "The
              $50 & Up Underground House Book," with these comments:<br>
              Is there an American with a sense of beauty who doesn’t hate the sight of the subdivisions which have
              defiled our landscape?<br>
              <br>
              Yet here is where underground housing offers one if its greatest potentials. By putting our subdivisions
              underground we can have neighborhoods of unequaled aesthetic appeal. Walking down the street of an
              underground subdivision would be like taking a walk in the park, or in the country. The stroller would see
              beautifully landscaped mounds with only an occasional door or window peeking out.<br>
              <br>
              Subterranean subdivisions would offer the ultimate in privacy and view. It would be possible to design so
              that no one house would have a view of another. Landscaped mounds of earth separating the sunken patios of
              the houses would not only ensure visual privacy but would be sound barriers as well.<br>
              <br>
              And there is the added benefit to the home owner of a doubling of his yard space since the roof becomes
              additional garden or lawn.<br>
              <br>
              <b>This is what the subdivisions of the future will be like.<br></b> Be sure to watch future issues of
              Countryside for in-depth articles on actual, lived-in underground homes, and on other forward thinkers
              like Mike Oehler, as well as on their many projects that can, should, and we believe will, forge a better
              world and a better life in the years ahead.
