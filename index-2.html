							    <p>&quot;Every winter, gardeners dream of owning a greenhouse&mdash;a warm and sometimes sunny place to tend plants and overwinter tropical favorites. If high heating bills have kept you from realizing that dream, this may be the book that inspires you to dig right in. The author lives in an earth-sheltered home and grows his own veggies in a working greenhouse that is heated by the sun. In chapters about glazing, insulation, heat tubes and pest management, you'll learn the basics of a solar-powered greenhouse and be treated to plans, photos and random notes about the process, including the use of rabbits as part of the growing cycle. The solar heat idea will work best if you have a hillside and sunny location, but you can harness the sun anyplace there is light and soil. The author also wrote &quot;The $50 &amp; Up Underground House Book&quot; and his home has been featured on HGTV and in various magazines. Even if you never intend to grow a thing, the book is a fascinating look into the mind of a modern day rebel.&quot; <strong><br>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This guy literally wrote the book on subterranean housing and sold more than (105,000) copies of <i>The $50 &amp; Up Underground House Book</i>. He lives in his own creation. It's a little snug but it's custom built and has all the creature comforts. You can barely see it, a dream get away nestled deep in the mountains of scenic Northern Idaho on 40 acres of land. Imagine it, all yours for $500. That's what subterranean pioneer Mike Oehler created when he... built one of the nations first underground houses in 1971... Today his little house in a hillside is a rustic gem... It's like having an underground log cabin... and somehow eight feet underground there's still lots of light here. Mike has developed what he calls an Up Hill Patio, a cut behind the house and into the hill, where plants can grow and light and air flow through the house. MIKE: &quot;I think I've got the only system in the country, maybe the world where you get light, air and views from two or three directions in each and every room in the underground house.'<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A beautiful mountain side, custom design, self-sufficiency and plenty of natural light even though you're underground, and all for $500. And maybe best of all, tranquility. MIKE: 'Its easy to heat, easy to cool, It's easy on your ears because it's much more soundproof in there.'<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's next for Mike Oehler? Well, he's writing a new book and he's designing and building a new (1800 sq. ft. underground) home. It's got a patio, and a tree house, and an underground pool and jacuzzi. And how much for this super house? $15,000.</p>

Using chalk board and the same scale models he hauled for years to universities across North America and Europe, Mike Oehler teaches his revolutionary methods of underground design. Rejecting for the most part the four common methods (the foolish four: skylights, atriums, vertical window wells and the disastrous first thought design) he teaches instead twelve methods which guarantee light, air and views from any and all directions of the compass in each underground room. No more dark, airless, basement-like underground buildings! As Mike likes to say, &quot;An underground house has no more in common with a basement than a penthouse apartment has with a hot, dark, dusty attic.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
Students of the course actually design five underground homes during the screening of this DVD using the included copyrighted design kit. These hands-on excursuses not only drill the methods home, they are actually fun! Those who complete this course wind up with a better concept of underground design than the vast majority of practicing architects today.<br>
In the second part of this two-hour DVD, Mike takes you on a personal tour of the four underground or earth sheltered houses on his land. You see real life applications of the Royer Foyer, Hollywood Wings, Up Hill Patios, Basic Designs and more.</font></p></font></td>

After a catastrophe, if surrounding above-ground houses have been destroyed, it may be lived in and used as the starting point for an underground house. In normal times the shelter may be used for a root cellar, spare bedroom, workshop, tool shed or kids play house. The cost of this 12x12 shelter will run from $100 to $1500 depending on how many recycled materials are used and how much of the work the owner does. Comprehensive shelter diagrams are included at no additional cost.<br>
                              <br>
The second part of this DVD teaches how to design and build a spectacularly effective earth sheltered greenhouse. The prototype for this, invented and built on Mike Oehler&#146;s 40 acres in mountainous North Idaho, 30 miles south of the Canadian boarder, has been in service for nearly a quarter century. Without any other heat source than sun and earth this greenhouse takes tomatoes into the second week in December and hardies like cabbage and kale clear through the winter year after year.<br>
<br>
The greenhouse is resistant to the ravages of gophers, moles, deer, rabbits and most other plant predators. It can even collect its own irrigation water. A 10x30 greenhouse should cost between $200 and $3000 depending upon materials and labor.<br>

<br>
The third part of the shelter DVD continues the tour of the underground structures on Mike&#146;s land including the earth-sheltered greenhouse.<br>

It promotes organic food grown in the closest local spot of all, your backyard. It does all this and saves you a bundle of money too! <em>The Earth-Sheltered Solar Greenhouse Book </em>&nbsp;details the benefits of both passive solar energy and earth sheltering in greenhouse design. This combination results in greenhouses which need no heating. The captured sun's energy and that which is stored in the earth is enough for successful year round harvest. Gone are costly heating bills. Gone is the squander of nonrenewable energy resources and the resultant atmospheric harm. </p>

The properly designed earth-sheltered greenhouse is naturally warmed at night -- and in the winter -- from five sides and loses heat from only one, the carefully selected glazing. The ratio is exactly reversed. This book tells all. It takes you step by step through the construction of an inexpensive greenhouse which may be built with either newly purchased or salvaged building materials at great savings. It explains the author's unique Post/Shoring/Polyethylene construction methods which <em>Countryside Magazine </em> called &ldquo;Revolutionary... innovative and ingenious... a totally different concept.&rdquo; The book deals heavily with design so that the reader may custom-build a greenhouse perfect for the particular climate and needs.</font></td>
