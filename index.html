                  This book illustrates and explains how to create an affordable underground house with far more
                  advantages than an above ground house. Explains step by step planning, materials, construction,
                  features, and some sample layouts to get you started. Along with much more. This is the book I plan to
                  use when I build my house. <strong><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is phenomenally wise, useful, easy to read, and plain inspiing. I picked it
                up this morning intending to get back to it tonight and ended up not putting it down at all.....<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book ends by discreetly recommending a (DVD) series on design as the key element
                for success, and one that professional architects generally overlook (as we are all learning, the
                "experts" in finance and other areas are really "credentialed" but NOT experts).<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I LIKE THIS BOOK. As an afterthought, it is recommended by just about every major
                alternative living, green energy, and sanity outpost (Vermont, Oregon, Washington State) reviewer. This
                book is a "good deal" and inspiring to boot<br>

                <p>"Every winter, gardeners dream of owning a greenhouse—a warm and sometimes sunny place to tend plants
                  and overwinter tropical favorites. If high heating bills have kept you from realizing that dream, this
                  may be the book that inspires you to dig right in. The author lives in an earth-sheltered home and
                  grows his own veggies in a working greenhouse that is heated by the sun. In chapters about glazing,
                  insulation, heat tubes and pest management, you'll learn the basics of a solar-powered greenhouse and
                  be treated to plans, photos and random notes about the process, including the use of rabbits as part
                  of the growing cycle. The solar heat idea will work best if you have a hillside and sunny location,
                  but you can harness the sun anyplace there is light and soil. The author also wrote "The $50 & Up
                  Underground House Book" and his home has been featured on HGTV and in various magazines. Even if you
                  never intend to grow a thing, the book is a fascinating look into the mind of a modern day rebel."

                          over above-ground housing are spectacular. It stays warm in the winter and cool in the summer.
                          It blends in with nature rather than rearing above it. It can double the yard space in a city.
                          To the neighbors it looks like a park. It is the most environmentally sound. It uses half the
                          building materials. It is the safest form of housing: it is fire resistant, radiation
                          resistant and is impervious to tornado and hurricane strength winds. It even does better in

                          frequently. (Check your schedule for future airings):</span></p>
                      <p><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy literally wrote the book on subterranean housing
                          and sold more than (105,000) copies of <i>The $50 & Up Underground House Book</i>. He lives in
                          his own creation. It's a little snug but it's custom built and has all the creature comforts.
                          You can barely see it, a dream get away nestled deep in the mountains of scenic Northern Idaho
                          on 40 acres of land. Imagine it, all yours for $500. That's what subterranean pioneer Mike
                          Oehler created when he... built one of the nations first underground houses in 1971... Today
                          his little house in a hillside is a rustic gem... It's like having an underground log cabin...
                          and somehow eight feet underground there's still lots of light here. Mike has developed what
                          he calls an Up Hill Patio, a cut behind the house and into the hill, where plants can grow and
                          light and air flow through the house. MIKE: "I think I've got the only system in the country,
                          maybe the world where you get light, air and views from two or three directions in each and
                          every room in the underground house.'<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A beautiful mountain side, custom design, self-sufficiency and plenty of
                          natural light even though you're underground, and all for $500. And maybe best of all,
                          tranquility. MIKE: 'Its easy to heat, easy to cool, It's easy on your ears because it's much
                          more soundproof in there.'<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's next for Mike Oehler? Well, he's writing a new book and he's
                          designing and building a new (1800 sq. ft. underground) home. It's got a patio, and a tree
                          house, and an underground pool and jacuzzi. And how much for this super house? $15,000.</span>

                          design. Rejecting for the most part the four common methods (the foolish four: skylights,
                          atriums, vertical window wells and the disastrous first thought design) he teaches instead
                          twelve methods which guarantee light, air and views from any and all directions of the compass
                          in each underground room. No more dark, airless, basement-like underground buildings! As Mike
                          likes to say, "An underground house has no more in common with a basement than a penthouse
                          apartment has with a hot, dark, dusty attic."<br>
                          <br>
                          Students of the course actually design five underground homes during the screening of this DVD
                          using the included copyrighted design kit. These hands-on excursuses not only drill the
                          methods home, they are actually fun! Those who complete this course wind up with a better
                          concept of underground design than the vast majority of practicing architects today.<br>
                          In the second part of this two-hour DVD, Mike takes you on a personal tour of the four
                          underground or earth sheltered houses on his land. You see real life applications of the Royer
                          Foyer, Hollywood Wings, Up Hill Patios, Basic Designs and more.</span></p>

                        how to build an astonishingly inexpensive shelter which can take your family and friends through
                        nuclear fallout, tornadoes, hurricanes, raging fires and even earthquakes. After a catastrophe,
                        if surrounding above-ground houses have been destroyed, it may be lived in and used as the
                        starting point for an underground house. In normal times the shelter may be used for a root
                        cellar, spare bedroom, workshop, tool shed or kids play house. The cost of this 12x12 shelter
                        will run from $100 to $1500 depending on how many recycled materials are used and how much of
                        the work the owner does. Comprehensive shelter diagrams are included at no additional cost.<br>
                        <br>
                        The second part of this DVD teaches how to design and build a spectacularly effective earth
                        sheltered greenhouse. The prototype for this, invented and built on Mike Oehler’s 40 acres in
                        mountainous North Idaho, 30 miles south of the Canadian boarder, has been in service for nearly
                        a quarter century. Without any other heat source than sun and earth this greenhouse takes
                        tomatoes into the second week in December and hardies like cabbage and kale clear through the
                        winter year after year.<br>
                        <br>
                        The greenhouse is resistant to the ravages of gophers, moles, deer, rabbits and most other plant
                        predators. It can even collect its own irrigation water. A 10x30 greenhouse should cost between
                        $200 and $3000 depending upon materials and labor.<br>
                        <br>
                        The third part of the shelter DVD continues the tour of the underground structures on Mike’s
                        land including the earth-sheltered greenhouse.<br>

                    <em>The Earth-Sheltered Solar Greenhouse Book</em> &nbsp;details the benefits of both passive solar
                    energy and earth sheltering in greenhouse design. This combination results in greenhouses which need
                    no heating. The captured sun's energy and that which is stored in the earth is enough for successful
                    year round harvest. Gone are costly heating bills. Gone is the squander of nonrenewable energy
                    resources and the resultant atmospheric harm.</span></p>

                  greenhouses get natural heat at night from only one side, the floor. They lose heat from the other
